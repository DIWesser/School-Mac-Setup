# jschool-mac-setup

This is a script to setup the Journalism school Macs to my liking, or at least as close as I can come while only having access to userspace.  

To use:  

1. Download (`curl -OsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIWesser/jschool-mac-setup/master/jschool-setup.sh`)
2. Make executable (`chmod +x jschool-setup.sh`)
3. run (`./jschool-setup.sh`)

As a single line, run `cd ~/Desktop && curl -OsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIWesser/jschool-mac-setup/master/jschool-setup.sh && chmod +x jschool-setup.sh && ./jschool-setup.sh && rm ~/Desktop/jschool-setup.sh` to download, run, and remove the script.  

The .app included in this repository can be placed on a thumb drive automatically run the install script with no further user involvment.
